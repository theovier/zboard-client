## Features

## Multi-Repository Project
This repository is part of a multi-repository project.
In total, it consists of three repositories: 
* [frontend](https://github.com/theovier/zboard-client)
* [backend](https://github.com/theovier/zboard-server)
* [docker-deployment](https://github.com/theovier/zboard-docker-deployment)

## Context
In its current state, the **Z-Board** is just a technical demonstration.
It is part of my master thesis and not to be treated as a serious, fully-fledged out project.
